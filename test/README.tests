Tests and demos are embedded with the source code of each function.
To run the tests for a specific function, use the test() built-in
command at the GNU Octave prompt. For example:

octave:1> test("qsmm1");

runs all tests for the qsmm1() function and shows the summary of
successes/failures. To run all tests for all functions you can either
use the runtests() built-in function, by specifying the full path where
the m-files for the queueing package are stored:

octave:2> runtests("/path/to/queueing/inst");

or using the Makefile contained in this directory that provides a
"check" target that runs all tests. From the top-level directory of
the queueing package development tree, you can issue the following
command at the Unix shell:

make check
