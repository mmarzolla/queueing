1 Installation and Getting Started
**********************************

1.1 Installation through Octave package management system
=========================================================

The most recent version of 'queueing' is 1.2.8 and can be downloaded
from

   <https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/queueing/>

   Additional information can be found at

   <https://www.moreno.marzolla.name/software/queueing/>

   To install 'queueing', follow these steps:

  1. If you have a recent version of GNU Octave and a network
     connection, you can install 'queueing' from the Octave command
     prompt using this command:

          octave:1> pkg install -forge queueing"

     The command above downloads the latest version of the 'queueing'
     package from Octave Forge and installs it on your machine.  You can
     also fetch directly from the source code repository:

          octave:1> pkg install "https://github.com/mmarzolla/queueing/releases/download/1.2.8/queueing-1.2.8.tar.gz"

     If you do not have root access, you can perform a local install
     with:

          octave:1> pkg install -local -forge queueing

     This installs 'queueing' in your home directory, and the package
     will be available to the current user only.

  2. Alternatively, you can first download the 'queueing' tarball from
     the url
     <https://github.com/mmarzolla/queueing/releases/download/1.2.8/queueing-1.2.8.tar.gz>.
     To install the package system-wide, issue this command at the
     Octave prompt:

          octave:1> pkg install queueing-1.2.8.tar.gz

     (you may need to start Octave as root to allow the installation to
     copy the files to the target locations).

     If you do not have root access, you can do a local install using:

          octave:1> pkg install -local queueing-1.2.8.tar.gz

  3. Use the 'pkg list' command at the Octave prompt to check that the
     'queueing' package has been succesfully installed; you should see
     something like:

          octave:1>pkg list queueing

          -| Package Name  | Version | Installation directory
          -| --------------+---------+-----------------------
          -|     queueing  |   1.2.8 | /home/moreno/octave/queueing-1.2.8

  4. Starting from version 1.1.1, 'queueing' is no longer automatically
     loaded at startup.  To make the functions available for use, you
     need to issue the following command at the Octave prompt:

          octave:1> pkg load queueing

     To automatically load 'queueing' each time Octave starts, add the
     command above to the startup script (usually, '~/.octaverc' on Unix
     systems).

  5. To completely remove 'queueing' from your system, use the 'pkg
     uninstall' command:

          octave:1> pkg uninstall queueing

1.2 Manual installation
=======================

If you want to manually install 'queueing' in a custom location, you can
download the tarball, unpack it and copy all '.m' files from the 'inst/'
directory to some target location, e.g., '/path/to/queueing/':

     curl "https://github.com/mmarzolla/queueing/releases/download/1.2.8/queueing-1.2.8.tar.gz"
     tar xvfz queueing-1.2.8.tar.gz
     cd queueing/inst/
     cp -r *.m /path/to/queueing/

   Then, start Octave with the '-p' option to add the target location to
the search path, so that Octave will find all 'queueing' functions
automatically:

     octave -p _/path/to/queueing/_

   If you want, you can add the following line to '~/.octaverc':

     addpath("_/path/to/queueing/_");

so that the path '/path/to/queueing/' is automatically added to the
search path each time Octave is started, and you no longer need to
specify the '-p' option on the command line.
