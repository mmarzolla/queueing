The queueing toolbox ("queueing", in short) is a collection of GNU
Octave scripts for numerical evaluation of queueing network
models. Open, closed and mixed networks are supported, with single or
multiple classes of customers. The queueing toolbox also provides
functions for steady-state and transient analysis of Markov chains, as
well as for single station queueing systems.

This package requires GNU Octave version 4.0.0 or later. GNU Octave is
free software and is available at https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

The Web pages of the queueing toolbox are

https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/queueing/
https://www.moreno.marzolla.name/software/queueing/

where the latest version can be downloaded.

The queueing toolbox comes with extensive documentation; you should
find the user manual in doc/queueing.pdf and doc/queueing.html in the
development source tree, and at the URLs above. Usage help for all
functions is available through the "help" built-in command at the GNU
Octave prompt. See the manual for details.
